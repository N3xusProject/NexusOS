An OS that just works!

## Building
Install limine, nasm, xorriso, mtools and qemu then type ``make``

## Running

Run either on hardware or some non-legacy VM other then QEMU and Virtualbox.<br>
Make sure your virtual/physical hard disk uses AHCI, we do not support anything else for now.<br>
In future updates we will have more hard disk drivers.

## Notes

Yes, I am aware it freezes on QEMU during boot. Not sure why,<br>
will try to figure it out.
