devctl is a syscall that exposes a driver's interface to userspace.
Each driver category has a "driver class id" to identifiy it.

The syscall can be used with driver class
in RBX and request ID in RCX, returns status in RAX.

See status in devctl_status.txt

AS OF NOW THERE ARE NO DRIVERS THAT SUPPORT THIS SYSCALL.
